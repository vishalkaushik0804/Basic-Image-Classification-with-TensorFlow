# Basic-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow
It is a trained Neural Network model that will be able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy.
It takes an image of a hand written digit as input and predicts the class of that digit, that is,it predicts the digit or it predicts the class of the input image.
This model is based on Keras with TensorFlow as its backend and use it to solve a basic image classification problem.
